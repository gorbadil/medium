# What is Azure Cloud

## Introduction

Azure is a cloud service provided by Microsoft. Azure offers a variety of services to its users, including server services, database services, storage services, network services, artificial intelligence services, analytics services, and many more. Azure allows users to develop, deploy, and manage their applications using these services.

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is a technology that provides access to computer systems and shared information and resources over the internet. Cloud computing allows users to use applications without having to install them on their own computers. These applications work by accessing servers over the internet, enabling users to use their applications from any device and any location.

## Cloud Concept

1. **Scalability:** Cloud computing allows users to increase or decrease resources according to their needs. This enables users to use resources as needed.

2. **Flexibility:** Cloud computing allows users to autonomously manage resources according to their needs. This enables users to manage resources as needed.

3. **Fault Tolerance:** Cloud computing allows users to protect their systems in case of failures. This enables users to protect their systems in case of failures.

4. **Backup:** Cloud computing allows users to back up their data. This enables users to securely store their data.

5. **High Availability:** Cloud computing allows users to access their applications from any device and any location, providing low latency and minimal downtime.

## Cloud Models

1. **Public Cloud:** Public cloud is a cloud service offered publicly. This service is provided to many different users simultaneously.

2. **Private Cloud:** Private cloud is a cloud service offered privately. This service is provided only to a specific group of users.

3. **Hybrid Cloud:** Hybrid cloud is a cloud service that combines public cloud and private cloud services. This service offers both public cloud and private cloud services together.

## Cloud Cost

Cloud computing allows users to pay according to their needs. This enables users to pay as needed. Cloud computing allows users to pay according to their needs. This enables users to pay as needed.

- **CapEx:** Capital Expenditure, used when users need to make an investment. This investment typically includes hardware and software purchases.

- **OpEx:** Operational Expenditure, refers to the expenses users pay when using a service. These expenses typically include subscription fees and usage fees.

## Azure Cloud Service Models

- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** IaaS allows users to use infrastructure services such as virtual machines, storage, and network services. Examples include Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Blob Storage, and Azure Virtual Network.

- **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** PaaS allows users to use application development and deployment services. Examples include Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Functions.

- **SaaS (Software as a Service):** SaaS allows users to use applications. Examples include Office 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure DevOps.

## Azure Global Infrastructure

Azure has data centers in many different regions around the world. These data centers enable users to deliver their applications quickly and securely worldwide. Azure has data centers in many different regions around the world. These data centers enable users to deliver their applications quickly and securely worldwide.

- **Geographic Region:** Azure has data centers in many different regions around the world. These data centers enable users to deliver their applications quickly and securely worldwide.

- **Region:** Azure regions are interconnected through a high-speed network backbone that provides low latency access to services.

- **Availability Zone:** An Availability Zone is an area within an Azure region consisting of one or more data centers. Availability Zones operate independently, providing high availability and fault tolerance.

## Azure Interaction Methods

- **Azure Portal:** Azure Portal allows users to manage Azure services. Azure Portal allows users to manage Azure services.

- **PowerShell and CLI:** Azure CLI allows users to manage Azure services through the command line. Azure CLI allows users to manage Azure services through the command line.

- **Azure SDK:** Azure SDK allows users to integrate their applications with Azure services. Azure SDK allows users to integrate their applications with Azure services.

- **REST API:** Azure REST API allows users to integrate their applications with Azure services. Azure REST API allows users to integrate their applications with Azure services.

- **IaC (Infrastructure as Code):** IaC allows users to manage infrastructure services through code. IaC allows users to manage infrastructure services through code.
  - **ARM Templates (Azure Resource Manager):** ARM templates defined in JSON format are used to manage Azure services.
  - **Terraform:** Terraform is a declarative language and tool used to manage infrastructure services.
  - **Bicep:** Bicep is a language and tool that makes ARM templates more readable and manageable.
